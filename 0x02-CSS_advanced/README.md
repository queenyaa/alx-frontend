Tasks found in this project covers:

1. **CSS Selectors, Properties, and Values**:
   - Selectors are patterns used to target specific elements in HTML documents.
   - Properties are attributes that define the visual appearance or behavior of selected elements.
   - Values are settings applied to properties to specify styles such as colors, sizes, and positions.

2. **CSS Reset and Normalization**:
   - CSS reset and normalization techniques help ensure consistency across different browsers by removing default styling and standardizing rendering.
   - CSS reset removes browser-specific defaults, while normalization aims to make default browser styles consistent across different browsers.

3. **Grid Systems with Floats**:
   - Grid systems create layout structures by dividing the page into columns and rows, allowing content to be organized effectively.
   - Grid systems using floats involve floating columns within a container and applying clearfix techniques to prevent collapsing.

4. **Icon Webfonts vs. SVG Icons**:
   - Icon webfonts use custom font files to represent icons, while SVG icons use vector graphics defined in XML format.
   - Icon webfonts are efficient and supported in older browsers, while SVG icons offer more flexibility and scalability.

5. **Background Gradients**:
   - CSS gradients allow for smooth transitions between colors, creating visually appealing backgrounds.
   - Linear and radial gradients can be defined with customizable directions, angles, and color stops.

6. **Animating Elements in CSS**:
   - CSS animations allow for dynamic movement and effects without JavaScript.
   - Animations can be created using keyframes for complex sequences or transitions for simple state-based effects.

7. **Transforming Elements in CSS**:
   - CSS transformations modify the appearance, position, and size of elements in both 2D and 3D space.
   - Transformations include translation, rotation, scaling, skewing, and 3D transformations.

By understanding and applying these CSS techniques, web developers can create visually appealing, responsive, and interactive web pages with consistent styling and layout across different browsers and devices.
