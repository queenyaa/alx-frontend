### Introduction
---

Responsive design involves creating fluid layouts and using CSS media queries to dynamically adjust the layout and styling based on the characteristics of the viewport, such as width, height, and orientation. It offers scalability, flexibility, and a consistent user experience across various screen sizes. Key techniques include using relative units like percentages, viewport units (vw and vh), and flexible length (fr) for creating responsive layouts.

Adaptive design, on the other hand, relies on predefined layouts optimized for specific screen sizes or devices. It typically involves server-side or client-side device detection to serve the appropriate layout based on the detected device characteristics. While adaptive design can offer faster initial page loads and more control over specific layouts, it may be less flexible and scalable compared to responsive design.

Both approaches have their advantages and considerations, and the choice between them depends on factors such as project requirements, target audience, and development resources. In summary, responsive design provides a more fluid and adaptable approach, while adaptive design offers more control over specific layouts tailored to predefined devices.
