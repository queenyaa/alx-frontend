1. **Semantic HTML Tags**: We discussed semantic HTML tags, which provide meaning to the content they enclose, making it easier for both browsers and developers to understand the structure and purpose of a webpage. Some common semantic tags include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and more.

2. **Embedding Content**: We talked about how to embed various types of content into a webpage, including images (`<img>`), videos (`<video>`), audio files (`<audio>`), and external content using iframes (`<iframe>`).

3. **Styling Text**: We covered how to style text using HTML tags such as `<b>` and `<strong>` for bold text, `<i>` and `<em>` for italic text, and `<u>` for underlined text.

4. **Structuring HTML Page**: We discussed the basic structure of an HTML page, including the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, as well as the use of metadata, title, and other elements within the `<head>` section.

5. **Linking Pages**: We touched on how to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag to link to other web pages, locations within the same page, files, or email addresses.

6. **Adding Horizontal Lines**: We learned how to add horizontal lines using the `<hr>` tag to visually separate content within a webpage.

7. **Changing Browser Tab Text**: We covered how to change the text displayed in the browser tab using the `<title>` tag within the `<head>` section of an HTML document.

8. **Heading Levels**: We mentioned that HTML5 provides 6 levels of heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) for organizing content with different levels of importance.

Overall, we've discussed various aspects of HTML, including semantic tags, content embedding, text styling, page structure, linking, and more, which are fundamental for creating well-structured, accessible, and visually appealing web pages.
